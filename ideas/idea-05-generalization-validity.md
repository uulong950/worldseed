# Idea 05: Validity of Generalization Across Worlds

## Status
Non-normative research idea.

## Motivation
Generalization is frequently claimed across datasets or domains
without justification that the underlying worlds are compatible.

## WorldSeed Dependency
Requires:
- world identity declarations
- explicit scope of claims

## Problem Statement
Given a learning result obtained in world W,
under what conditions is a generalization claim to world W′
semantically valid?

## Expected Outcome (Non-Commitment)
Formal criteria distinguishing valid generalization
from category error.

## Notes
This reframes generalization as a semantic question.
