# Idea 01: Conditions for World Comparability

## Status
Non-normative research idea.

## Motivation
Many empirical learning results are compared
without explicit justification that they arise
from the same world assumptions.

## WorldSeed Dependency
Requires explicit declarations of:
- world identity
- observers
- sensing boundaries
- degradation operators

## Problem Statement
Given two declared worlds W₁ and W₂,
under what conditions are statistical quantities,
risk measures, or generalization claims
meaningfully comparable?

## Expected Outcome (Non-Commitment)
Characterization theorems or no-go results
establishing when comparability is preserved
or provably impossible.

## Notes
This problem is independent of any specific model or algorithm.
