# Idea 01: Conditions for World Comparability

## Status
Non-normative research idea.

## Motivation
Learning results, benchmarks, and empirical claims are routinely compared
without explicit justification that they arise from the same world assumptions.

This leads to conclusions that are empirically suggestive but semantically undefined.

## WorldSeed Dependency
Requires explicit declarations of:
- world identity
- admissible actions
- observers
- sensing boundaries
- degradation operators

## Problem Statement
Given two declared worlds W₁ and W₂,
under what conditions are empirical quantities
(e.g. accuracy, risk, generalization error)
meaningfully comparable as statements about the same world?

## Expected Outcome (Non-Commitment)
Characterization results or impossibility theorems
that delineate when comparability is preserved
and when it is undefined.

## Notes
This problem is independent of specific models, datasets, or algorithms.
