# Idea 07: Causal Identifiability Under Declared Actions

## Status
Non-normative research idea.

## Motivation
Causal claims are often made without explicit declaration
of admissible actions or interventions.

## WorldSeed Dependency
Requires:
- explicit action semantics
- causally complete action sets

## Problem Statement
Given a declared action space,
which causal relationships are identifiable,
and which are fundamentally untestable?

## Expected Outcome (Non-Commitment)
Identifiability theorems conditioned on action completeness.

## Notes
Distinct from purely statistical causality.
