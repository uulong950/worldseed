# Idea 06: Decidability of WorldSeed Compliance

## Status
Non-normative research idea.

## Motivation
WorldSeed compliance is intended to be mechanically checkable,
but the theoretical limits of such checking are unexplored.

## WorldSeed Dependency
Requires:
- formal world declarations
- explicit axioms

## Problem Statement
Is compliance with a given WorldSeed profile decidable?
What fragments are decidable, semi-decidable, or undecidable?

## Expected Outcome (Non-Commitment)
Complexity bounds or undecidability results.

## Notes
Analogous to decidability questions in logic and type systems.
