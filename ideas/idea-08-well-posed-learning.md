# Idea 08: Well-Posedness of Learning Problems

## Status
Non-normative research idea.

## Motivation
Some learning problems are ill-posed not due to algorithms,
but due to underspecified worlds.

## WorldSeed Dependency
Requires:
- explicit state ontology
- sensing boundaries
- degradation declarations

## Problem Statement
When is a learning task well-posed
as a problem about a declared world?

## Expected Outcome (Non-Commitment)
Necessary conditions for existence or uniqueness of solutions.

## Notes
This parallels well-posedness in PDE theory.
