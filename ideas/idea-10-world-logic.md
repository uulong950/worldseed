# Idea 10: A Logic of World-Relative Claims

## Status
Non-normative research idea.

## Motivation
Many disputes arise from mixing claims across incompatible worlds.

## WorldSeed Dependency
Requires:
- explicit claim scopes
- world identity

## Problem Statement
Is it possible to define a formal logic
in which the validity of a claim is indexed to a declared world?

## Expected Outcome (Non-Commitment)
World-indexed modal or typed logics.

## Notes
This concerns claim legitimacy, not truth.
