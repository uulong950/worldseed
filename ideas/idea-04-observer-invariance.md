# Idea 04: Observer Invariance of Learning Claims

## Status
Non-normative research idea.

## Motivation
Learning claims are often implicitly tied to specific sensing setups,
yet presented as observer-independent truths.

## WorldSeed Dependency
Requires:
- explicit observer definitions
- sensing boundary declarations

## Problem Statement
Under what transformations of observers
do learning claims remain invariant,
and under what transformations do they lose meaning?

## Expected Outcome (Non-Commitment)
Invariance conditions or observer-dependent equivalence classes.

## Notes
This problem separates physical reality from measurement.
