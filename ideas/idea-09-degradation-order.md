# Idea 09: Ordering Worlds by Degradation

## Status
Non-normative research idea.

## Motivation
Representations are often compared without acknowledging
that they discard different distinctions.

## WorldSeed Dependency
Requires:
- explicit degradation operators
- distinguishability semantics

## Problem Statement
Can declared worlds be partially ordered
by their induced degradation structure?

## Expected Outcome (Non-Commitment)
Lattice or preorder structures over world representations.

## Notes
This reframes representation learning as ordering, not optimization.
