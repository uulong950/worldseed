# Idea 03: Formal Limits Induced by Irreversible Degradation

## Status
Non-normative research idea.

## Motivation
Many failures in learning are attributed to optimization or data scarcity,
while the true cause is irreversible loss of distinguishability.

## WorldSeed Dependency
Requires:
- explicit degradation operators
- declared sensing boundaries

## Problem Statement
Given a declared degradation operator D,
what properties of world states or functions
become provably unlearnable or non-identifiable?

## Expected Outcome (Non-Commitment)
No-go theorems relating degradation structure
to limits on inference or reconstruction.

## Notes
This is not an information-theoretic problem alone;
it is a semantic one.
