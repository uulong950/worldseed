# Idea 02: World Equivalence and Identity

## Status
Non-normative research idea.

## Motivation
Systems are often treated as operating in the "same environment"
based on superficial similarity, while differing in unexamined assumptions.

## WorldSeed Dependency
Requires:
- explicit world identity
- declared causal actions
- observer definitions

## Problem Statement
Define necessary and sufficient conditions
under which two declared worlds may be considered equivalent
for the purposes of learning claims or empirical comparison.

## Expected Outcome (Non-Commitment)
Formal equivalence relations or partial orders over declared worlds.

## Notes
World equivalence is not visual similarity or parameter equality.
