# WorldSeed Blog Series

This directory contains a finite series of explanatory posts
accompanying the WorldSeed specification.

These posts are **non-normative**.
They do not define rules, axioms, or compliance criteria.
All normative authority remains with:

- the WorldSeed specification,
- the axioms (S1–S19),
- and WorldSeed Lint.

The purpose of this blog series is to clarify
how WorldSeed changes the interpretation of learning claims,
without expanding or redefining the framework.

## Structure and Roles

Each blog serves a distinct and limited role.
Together, they form a closed explanatory arc.

### Blog-01 — Scale

**When the World Becomes a First-Class Object**

Explains why many long-standing debates in machine learning
collapse once the world is made explicit.

This post introduces the *scale shift*:
from comparing results to auditing their semantic admissibility.

---

### Blog-02 — Verdicts

**Casebook: Semantic Verdicts Under Explicit World Declaration**

Demonstrates how WorldSeed-style judgments operate in practice.

Each case follows a strict pattern:
facts → checks → violations → verdict.

No optimization, recommendations, or interpretations are offered.

---

### Blog-03 — Structural Recurrence

**The Same Problem, Reappearing**

Shows that the issue of implicit worlds
is not unique to machine learning,
but reappears in human communication and disagreement.

This is a structural observation, not a cognitive theory.

---

### Blog-04 — Limits

**Why WorldSeed Stops Here**

Defines the boundaries of the framework.

Explains why WorldSeed must not be extended
into theories of intelligence, cognition, or explanation,
and why restraint is essential for normative systems.

---

### Blog-05 — Handover

**After the Framework**

Clarifies how WorldSeed may be used, misused, extended, or rejected.

This post explicitly transfers responsibility
from the author to the community,
while preserving semantic boundaries.

## Final Note

This blog series is complete.

It exists to support correct interpretation,
not to grow indefinitely.

Future work—such as tools, profiles, or applications—
does not require additional blog posts
unless it introduces new non-normative explanation needs.

WorldSeed itself does not evolve through blogs.
It evolves, if at all, through specification changes.
