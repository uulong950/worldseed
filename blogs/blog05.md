## After the Framework

**On use, misuse, and responsibility**

---

## Scope and Intent

This post does not extend WorldSeed.

It does not introduce new axioms,
new verdicts,
or new interpretations.

Its purpose is practical and final:

to clarify how WorldSeed may be used,
how it may be misused,
and where responsibility lies.

Once a framework becomes public,
its future is no longer controlled by its author.
This document exists to make that transition explicit.

## 1. WorldSeed as an Instrument, Not a Position

WorldSeed is a semantic instrument.

It determines whether learning claims are
admissible,
scoped,
and comparable
under explicitly declared worlds.

It does not represent a stance
on models,
methods,
or research agendas.

Using WorldSeed does not signal agreement.
Rejecting WorldSeed does not signal error.

It is a tool,
not a worldview.

---

## 2. Legitimate Uses

WorldSeed may be legitimately used to:

- audit the scope of learning claims,
- determine whether comparisons are admissible,
- expose undeclared assumptions,
- separate empirical success from semantic overreach.

These uses require no endorsement of any method
and impose no obligation to adopt any practice.

They require only explicit declaration.

---

## 3. Illegitimate Uses

WorldSeed MUST NOT be used to:

- rank models or methods,
- dismiss empirical results,
- enforce uniform pipelines,
- claim theoretical superiority,
- settle philosophical or ethical disputes.

Such uses fall outside WorldSeed’s scope
and carry no normative authority.

Invoking WorldSeed in these contexts
does not make the invocation valid.

---

## 4. Disagreement and Non-Compliance

Disagreement with WorldSeed is allowed.

A researcher may reject its axioms,
ignore its verdicts,
or choose not to declare worlds.

The only consequence is this:

claims made under such conditions
cannot simultaneously claim WorldSeed compliance.

There is no penalty.
There is no enforcement beyond semantics.

WorldSeed does not compel adoption.
It conditions claims.

---

## 5. On Community Extensions

WorldSeed does not prohibit extensions.

Others may propose:

- alternative axioms,
- additional verdicts,
- domain-specific profiles,
- convenience tools.

Such extensions are not WorldSeed
unless explicitly declared as such.

Compatibility must be declared.
Authority must not be implied.

Forking is allowed.
Conflation is not.

---

## 6. Authorial Responsibility

The author of WorldSeed is responsible for:

- the content of the specification,
- the defined axioms,
- the reference implementations.

The author is not responsible for:

- downstream interpretations,
- derived frameworks,
- applications in other domains.

This separation is intentional
and necessary.

---

## Closing Statement

Frameworks do not become useful
by being protected.

They become useful
by being bounded.

WorldSeed is offered as a completed semantic instrument.
Its use is optional.
Its limits are not.

What happens next
belongs to the community.
